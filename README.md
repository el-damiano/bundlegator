Bundlegator is a web scraper and RSS feed generator. It's only meant to output
a valid RSS feed and doesn't come with reading functionality. For that I
recommend a terminal RSS reader [Newsboat](https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat).

I created it for HumbleBundle and Fanatical to get more information about the
books in their bundles, such as ISBNs and release dates. Gaming and software
bundles are supported as well.

I kept `requirements.txt` minimal as I valued portability and since I finished
the [OOP](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-object-oriented-programming) and
[FP](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-functional-programming) courses on
[Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev), I wanted to put my skills to the test.
